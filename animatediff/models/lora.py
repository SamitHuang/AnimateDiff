class LoRALinearLayer(nn.Module):
    r"""
    A linear layer that is used with LoRA.

    Parameters:
        in_features (`int`):
            Number of input features.
        out_features (`int`):
            Number of output features.
        rank (`int`, `optional`, defaults to 4):
            The rank of the LoRA layer.
        network_alpha (`float`, `optional`, defaults to `None`):
            The value of the network alpha used for stable learning and preventing underflow. This value has the same
            meaning as the `--network_alpha` option in the kohya-ss trainer script. See
            https://github.com/darkstorm2150/sd-scripts/blob/main/docs/train_network_README-en.md#execute-learning
        device (`torch.device`, `optional`, defaults to `None`):
            The device to use for the layer's weights.
        dtype (`torch.dtype`, `optional`, defaults to `None`):
            The dtype to use for the layer's weights.
